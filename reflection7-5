the effect of memory size on the trajectory

when batch size is small the trajectory is not orthogonal to the contour lines

reason 1:
since we use PCA, it just copress everything into a 2D plane, the actual position of a point is different from the value shown on the 2D contour -> less likely since the trajectory is in low dimension and the explained variance ratio is high like [0.6-0.75, 0.1-0.2]

reason 2:
the destribution of samples is not uniform when the memory is not large enough.
so the batch sampled from the memory can be biased, preventing the trajectory going in the optimal direction
